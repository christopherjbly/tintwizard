Thank you for downloading tintwizard!

See http://code.google.com/p/tintwizard/ for more information

See http://code.google.com/p/tintwizard/wiki/Help for help

To run tintwizard, navigate to the folder where tintwizard.py was
extracted to and double click on the file. Alternatively use a
terminal to navigate to this location and type ./tintwizard.py
to run. If neither of these work you may have to change
permissions to allow it to run.

chmod +x tintwizard.py

should do the trick.
